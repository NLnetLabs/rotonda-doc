Where to go from here
=====================

This was a very quick tour of the some of the current features of Rotonda.
We've showed you how to run Rotonda with some mock data, do some configuration
and create and modify a roto script.

You may want to run Rotonda, while inserting real BGP/BMP data, read about
`Connectors` here, to set up a BGP or BMP session.

You can read more about the roto language here. Finally you could read about
the details of RIB units here.

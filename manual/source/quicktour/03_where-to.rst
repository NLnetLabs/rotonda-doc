Where to go from here
=====================

This was a very quick tour of the some of the current features of Rotonda.
We've showed you how to run Rotonda with some mock data, do some configuration
and create and modify a roto script.

You may want to run Rotonda, while inserting real BGP/BMP data, read about
`connector` units :doc:`here </units/connector>`, to set up a BGP or BMP
session.

When you've got one or more connectors working, you probably want to change
one or more Roto filters. Read more about it :doc:`here </roto/introduction>`.

Finally you could read about
the details of the various units :doc:`here </units/introduction>`.
